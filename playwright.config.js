// Shard sizes, one vector per engine, expressed as the number of tests each
// shard should carry. Playwright's default shard split divides the suite by
// test count alone, and test counts are a poor proxy for cost: collaboration
// (18 tests) took 431 worker-seconds on webkit while 29 tests of agent
// validation took 37. The vectors below are the min-max partitions of the
// per-file worker-seconds, each computed over the slower of two independent
// runs (green 37079716969 at 9e75c75 and 37084442565 at 8218bb3, in which two
// legs died at the globalTimeout and contribute no measurement for the tests
// that never ran there) so the split does not overfit one fast window: a
// first split measured against a single run put webkit 8/10 and chromium 5/5
// within seconds of the cap in the next run, which executed the same files up
// to 1.6x slower. They put every predicted shard step at or under about
// seventeen minutes against the twenty minute promise below, with the caveat
// that files inside the two capacity-killed shards are measured only by the
// green run, so their envelope can be biased low. Playwright reads these
// through PWTEST_SHARD_WEIGHTS after this config is imported, so setting it
// here reaches the runner. Each CI leg runs exactly one --project, which is
// why one vector per engine is enough; a leg without --shard must not set the
// variable at all, because weights without a shard are a usage error.
//
// These are measurements, not preferences: adding tests to a heavy file, or
// splitting one, shifts the balance. Re-measure (worker-seconds per file per
// engine from the artifacts of recent runs, min-max partitioned) before
// touching the vectors, and never hand one a shard that runs no tests.
